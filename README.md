## Introduction

This is a plugin to support the [Q2A Notify](https://github.com/pvginkel/Q2ANotify)
application.

This plugin provides a notification feed to the Q2A Notify application.

## Installation

To install, follow the following steps:

* Download a ZIP file through the **Clone or download** link on the main GitHub page;
* Extract this into the `qa-plugin` directory of your installation. Ensure that
  the files of the plugin are stored in a subdirectory named `qa-notify` in the
  `qa-plugin` directory;
* Go to the plugins page in the administration area;
* Open the **options** of the **Notification feed plugin for Q2A Notifier** plugin;
* Click **Activate Plugin** and then **Save Changes**.

You'll then be asked to update the database. Make sure that after the database
changes have been made, the **Activate Plugin** checkbox is still checked.

After installation of the plugin, the [Q2A Notify](https://github.com/pvginkel/Q2ANotify)
application should show notifications. See the documentation of that application
for more information.
